## Delaware Technical Test

I created 3 components in total.

The main component is **App** which is also the only class component with state.

Inside the App component the data is being fetched and stored in a larger array that collects all the arrays being fetched.

The **FetchRowData** components consists of a button with an onClick event that fetches the data.

The **InsertDataInTable** component takes care of rendering the elements of the array into the table cells.

*The link provided was quite quickly out of use with a 502 error message.
Therefore I was unfortunately not able to fully test my code.*

This project was created using facebook's **create-react-app.**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory (= delaware-test), you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
